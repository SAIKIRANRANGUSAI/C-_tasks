Week 3: HMI Simulation System
Overview
Week 3 focuses on implementing the core components of the HMI Simulation System, including the Menu Navigation System, Instrument Cluster Data Display, Event Handling for Touchscreen Input, and HMI Skin Customization System. These components work together to provide an interactive simulation of a typical automotive Human-Machine Interface (HMI).

Tasks and Implementation
Task 1: Menu Navigation System
Description: Implemented a hierarchical menu navigation system using C++ classes and data structures.
Features:
Navigation through multiple levels (up, down, enter, and back).
Console-based display of menu options.
User interaction through keyboard for menu navigation.
Task 2: Simulate Instrument Cluster Data Display
Description: Created a real-time vehicle data display system.
Features:
Displays parameters like speed, fuel level, and engine temperature.
Threshold warnings for critical parameters such as fuel and engine temperature.
Task 3: Event Handling for Touchscreen Input
Description: Designed an event-driven system to handle touchscreen interactions like taps and swipes.
Features:
Event class representation for user actions.
Event queue management to process multiple interactions.
Handled specific touch events like tap, swipe, and multitouch.
Task 4: HMI Skin Customization System
Description: Developed a system to customize the appearance of the HMI interface.
Features:
Customizable themes (colors, fonts, etc.).
std::map used to store and manage multiple themes.
User interface to preview and select skins.
