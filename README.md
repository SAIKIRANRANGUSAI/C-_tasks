HMI Simulation System
Project Overview
This project implements a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) simulation system in C++. The system aims to simulate functionalities commonly found in automotive HMI clusters, with components including a menu navigation system, vehicle data display, event handling for touchscreen input, and skin customization.

Project Objectives
Menu Navigation System: Create a hierarchical menu for navigation.
Instrument Cluster Data Display: Simulate real-time vehicle data display.
Touchscreen Event Handling: Implement an event-driven system for user interactions.
Skin Customization: Develop a system for theme and skin management.
Requirements
Programming Language: C++11 or higher
Compiler: g++, clang++, or compatible C++ compiler
Standard Libraries: <iostream>, <map>, <string>, <vector>, <thread>, <queue>, <random>, <chrono>
Tasks and Implementation
Task 1: Menu Navigation System
Description: Implemented a hierarchical menu system using C++ classes and data structures.
Features:
Navigation through menu levels (up, down, enter, back).
Display menu options in the console.
Keyboard interaction for menu navigation.
Task 2: Simulate Instrument Cluster Data Display
Description: Developed a vehicle data display system with real-time updates for parameters such as speed, fuel level, and engine temperature.
Features:
Class-based design for data management.
Warnings for parameter thresholds.
Task 3: Event Handling for Touchscreen Input
Description: Created an event-driven system to handle touchscreen interactions.
Features:
Event class representation for user actions.
Event queue management for processing multiple interactions.
Handling of specific touch events like Tap and Swipe.
Task 4: HMI Skin Customization System
Description: Designed a system to handle different themes or skins for the HMI display.
Features:
Theme class with customizable attributes like colors and font size.
Use of std::map to store and manage multiple themes.
User interface for theme preview and selection.
Week 4 Tasks: STL Algorithm Practice
Task 1: Working with STL Algorithms
Goal: Practice using STL algorithms to manage HMI control states.
Algorithms Used: std::for_each, std::find, std::find_if, std::adjacent_find, std::count, std::count_if, std::equal.
Task 2: Iterating and Finding in Containers
Goal: Iterate through containers and find specific elements.
Containers: std::vector for dynamic widgets, std::set for static widgets.
Operations:
Print dynamic widgets.
Search for widgets using iterators.
Task 3: Advanced STL Operations
Goal: Perform transformations and modifications on HMI control states.
Operations: std::copy, std::fill, std::generate, std::transform, std::replace, std::remove_if, std::reverse, std::partition.
Task 4: Sorting, Searching, and Merging
Goal: Practice sorting and merging containers and using set operations.
Operations: std::sort, std::stable_sort, std::lower_bound, std::upper_bound, std::merge, std::inplace_merge, std::set_union, std::set_intersection.
Task 5: Implementing Design Patterns
Goal: Implement common design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy.
Examples:
Singleton: HMISystem class for managing HMI state.
Factory: Creating Button, Slider instances.
Observer: Notify widgets on mode change.
Strategy: Define rendering behaviors for 2D vs. 3D.
Usage
Compile the Code:

g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main
Run the Program:

./main
