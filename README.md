# HMI Simulation System

## Project Overview
The **HMI Simulation System** is a C++-based project that simulates the key functionalities of an automotive **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)**. It incorporates features like menu navigation, real-time data display, touchscreen event handling, and skin customization. Advanced **STL algorithms** and **design patterns** were also integrated to enhance the systemâ€™s functionality and scalability.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

- **Menu Navigation**: Create a hierarchical menu system for navigation.
- **Instrument Cluster Display**: Simulate real-time vehicle data such as speed, fuel, and temperature.
- **Touchscreen Event Handling**: Implement event-driven touchscreen interactions.
- **Skin Customization**: Allow users to customize the appearance of the HMI.
- **STL Algorithms**: Apply various algorithms for container management and manipulation.
- **Design Patterns**: Use design patterns to improve system architecture.

## Week 3 Tasks:
- **Menu Navigation System**: Developed a system for navigating through menus.
- **Data Display**: Simulated real-time vehicle data with thresholds and warnings.
- **Event Handling**: Designed an event-driven system for touchscreen gestures.
- **Skin Customization**: Implemented a customizable skin system for HMI interfaces.

## Week 4 Tasks:
- **STL Algorithms**: Used algorithms like `std::for_each`, `std::find`, `std::copy` for manipulating HMI states.
- **Design Patterns**: Applied **Singleton**, **Factory**, **Observer**, and **Strategy** patterns to enhance the system structure.
